# Include a text file into the current template, at this location.  Single include, only command processing is performed.
include:
  prefix: "%%INCLUDE%%("
  postfix: ")%%"

# Do nothing with the specified value.  This allows includes to be turned off, while essentially leaving them in-place as
#   documentation.  A more advanced use of this is to toggle 2 or more includes, so all are comments except the active one.
#   This allows for "hard-coding" template changes, while still making all the other possible options visible in the same
#   place in the template file.
comment:
  prefix: "%%COMMENT%%("
  postfix: ")%%"


# Process value as a Spec file.  This allows for embedding complexity and provides another option for templating.
#       These will be YAML or JSON spec configuration files, compared to include which imports text.
process:
  prefix: "%%PROCESS%%("
  postfix: ")%%"
