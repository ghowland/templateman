# TemplateMan Example Datasources - ./conf/datasources is the default path, so populating this for easy examples.

#   Replace these with your own sources.  Either SQL databases or YAML/JSON files of your own (manually typed or generated)

# MySQL ops database - Using databases provides more flexible templating with SQL
ops:

# YAML Data files - Examples of data being kept in YAML files, to test this functionality
#   While data files are less flexible than SQL, they can be be generated to be fully de-normalized which can provide just
#   as good data sources as a SQL query.  These are hand-entered to show what a small text-file based manual data system would
#   look like, which is easy to check into version control.
#
# YAML files are treated as Python lists of dicts, so records/rows of fields (key/value)

  # Relationships are used to flatten a data set that would typically use a JOIN in SQL.  All fields from the related
  #   record are embedded in current record under the field name "relation_field.target_field".
  relationship:
    # Example: new fields are added to machine records:  service.id, service.name, service.info
    #   These field can then be accessed in a de-normalized fashion, which essentially created a INNER JOIN between these
    #   YAML file data
